# clone_to_azure
Bash scripts used for importing github and gitlab repos to azure.

# TODO
* Delete all txt files at the end
* Make one script for github + gitlab
* Insert variable names via command line
* Check if azure repo already exists
* Print only import status from az output table
* Check progress with a counter
* Better handling of repo names
* If the script fails at some point, it would be nice to easily start from where it stopped instead of changing things by hand
